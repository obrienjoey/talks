  # **What is Webscraping All About?**

  - ## The web is essentially a repository for data.
--

  - ## In order to store and display that data the websites have to be coded - generally in **HTML** or **Javascript**.
--

  ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='90%'}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/fpl_home.jpg")

  # **Why webscrape?**

  - ## Many important publications use novel datasets to determine previously unconsidered phenomena
       - #### Think Stanley Milgrams research into the _six degrees of seperation_.
       - #### One of the many studies into citation dynamics.
--
  - ## Some fields suffer from 'Zachary Karate Club Syndrome'

  ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='50%'}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/zkcc.jpg")

       - #### One of the many studies into citation dynamics.

  - ## Some fields suffer from 'Zachary Karate Club Syndrome'

  - ## Give you a chance to do _research_ on something that really interests you.

  # **Key Packages**
  
  - ## In R there are two main packages used to actually scrape the data XML2 and rvest.
      ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='20%'}
      knitr::include_graphics("images/rvest.png")
      ```
--
  - ## Python equivalents are beautifulsoup and requests.
